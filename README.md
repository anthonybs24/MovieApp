# MovieApp

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to a simple movie app for Android. It's part of the Udacity Android Mobile App Nanodegree program. 

## Design
The movie app will connect to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org) and display list of movie posters to users based on user's preference (popularity or top rated). User will be able to play trailer of the movie and see review of the movie from within the app. 

## Instructions
To install the app, I'd recommend to download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/). After installing Android studio, download and compile the code. Then you can generate an apk file to install on an Android device or you can run it directly on Android Studio Emulator
